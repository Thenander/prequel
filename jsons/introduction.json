    "paragraph": "This is a trip back in time. Before Cultivated Bimbo became Cultivated Bimbo.\nAll songs in this collection was written and/or recorded from 1985 to 1990. Here you will find short song ideas, original versions of Cultivated Bimbo songs, complete demos from a time when cassette tapes was the only recording option. You will find seeds of great songs by Cultivated Bimbo, and notice samples you might have heard on Energy Rekords releases later on."

    "paragraph": "Also included are the 12 tracks that were released on CD (\"Prequel\", Progress Productions) earlier 2020. They are now remastered and edited especially for this compilation. Two bonus tracks decorated 2020 are included as well.\nAll in all, this is a massive 222-tracks collection (over 12 hours) where the quality will vary wildly because of recording equipment, good or bad song ideas, instruments and so on. With that in mind, we hope you will find YOUR favourites among the many, many tracks included."
